# u-unwrap2D
## Library for 2D Contour-guided computing

#### August 29, 2024
u-Unwrap2D is a Python library built on top of u-Unwrap3D to map 2D contours and images into canonical representations to facilitate analysis with particular attention to single cell biology.

Currently there is no manuscript associated with u-Unwrap2D. 

For more info on idealogy of u-Unwrap3D please see:
[**Surface-guided computing to analyze subcellular morphology and membrane-associated signals in 3D**](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.12.536640), *bioRxiv*, 2023, written by Felix Y. Zhou, Andrew Weems, Gabriel M. Gihana, Bingying Chen, Bo-Jui Chang, Meghan K. Driscoll and [Gaudenz Danuser](https://www.danuserlab-utsw.org/).


## Library Features

|Module                   |Functionality|
|-------------------------|-------------|
|unwrap2D       	  | Functions for unwrapping 2D contours and mapping images to disk and square representations. Much recycle/adapt u-Unwrap3D functions.|


## Getting Started
The simplest way to get started is to check out the included notebooks which walks through the steps described in the paper for obtaining all representation starting from step0: the extraction of surface from a binary cell segmentation.
